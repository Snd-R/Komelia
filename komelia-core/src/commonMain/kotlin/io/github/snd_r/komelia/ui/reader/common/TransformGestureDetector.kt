/**
 * A gesture detector for rotation, panning, and zoom. Once touch slop has been reached, the
 * user can use rotation, panning and zoom gestures. [onGesture] will be called when any of the
 * rotation, zoom or pan occurs, passing the rotation angle in degrees, zoom in scale factor and
 * pan as an offset in pixels. Each of these changes is a difference between the previous call
 * and the current gesture. This will consume all position changes after touch slop has
 * been reached. [onGesture] will also provide centroid of all the pointers that are down.
 *
 * If [panZoomLock] is `true`, rotation is allowed only if touch slop is detected for rotation
 * before pan or zoom motions. If not, pan and zoom gestures will be detected, but rotation
 * gestures will not be. If [panZoomLock] is `false`, once touch slop is reached, all three
 * gestures are detected.
 *
 * Example Usage:
 * @sample androidx.compose.foundation.samples.DetectTransformGestures
